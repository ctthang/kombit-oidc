# Local emergency-access setup record

> Historical setup/test record. For current configuration-file API keys, complete normal claim snapshots, and 24-hour / 1-hour / 30-day lifetimes, follow the current emergency setup guide. Environment-variable and shorter-lifetime instructions below describe the earlier deployment.


Date: 20 October 2026. This records the setup performed for the local OIDC example and Identify tenant. For reusable instructions, see [README-emergency.md](README-emergency.md).

> Later change: the local operator role, operator page, and acceptance switch were removed. A prepared browser can now log in without operator approval, and `OIDC_EMERGENCY_OPERATOR_KEY` is no longer used. The steps below are kept as a record of the original setup.

## Deployment and identifiers

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Identify tenant | `https://dev520.safewhere.local` |
| Identify Runtime | `C:\Program Files\Safewhere\Identify\Tenants\dev520\runtime` |
| Identify pool | `Identify dev520` |
| OIDC application | `https://kombitoidc.safewhere.local` |
| OIDC deployment | `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\kombitoidc` |
| OIDC pool | `kombitoidc.safewhere.local` |
| Normal issuer | `https://dev520.safewhere.local/runtime/oauth2` |
| Emergency issuer | `https://dev520.safewhere.local/runtime/emergency` |
| Issuer API base | `https://dev520.safewhere.local/runtime/` |
| Emergency audience | `urn:emergency:oidc-example` |
| Protocol connection GUID | `01be44ed-814f-4db9-a3a6-8b1f28b3d6a5` |

The normal OIDC client ID was read from the deployed `OpenIdConnectOptions.ClientId`. The user supplied the connection GUID. Identify uses that GUID to match normal-token capture to the configured protocol connection; it is distinct from the OIDC client ID.

## Initial findings

Normal login was already working, as confirmed by the user. The OIDC discovery document returned HTTP 200 with the expected normal issuer.

The encryption-key tool had already created `decryption-key.bin` and `encryption-public.jwk.json` under `C:\ProgramData\SafewhereSamples\OidcEmergency`. The directory already allowed the OIDC application-pool identity to modify its contents. These keys were reused.

Three configuration gaps prevented emergency setup:

1. The deployed sample had only `EmergencyCredential.Enabled=true`. Its complete settings existed in an external JSON file, but this application does not automatically load that file.
2. Identify had `EmergencyIssuer.Enabled=true` but no `EmergencyIssuer.SettingsFile`. Its public emergency signing-key endpoint returned HTTP 503.
3. Both existing machine environment variables for the backend and operator secrets were shorter than 32 characters. The application requires 32–512 characters.

The sample also needed compatibility with Identify's new `state_id` field. That code correction was completed before deployment.

## Code correction and verification

The sample now persists the issuer state ID. Online preparation, renewal, and operator synchronization check that identity. A changed ID, or legacy state without an ID, blocks old credentials and sessions, disables acceptance, clears pending login/enrollment/possession evidence, and resets the revocation cursor. Old queued removals are discarded because the new issuer state cannot identify those bindings.

Signing-key refresh is bracketed by matching state-ID observations. Synchronizations are serialized, and generation checks reject stale credential responses. If recovery interrupts trust refresh, the blocked state and pending-refresh marker survive restart. Acceptance cannot be enabled until a stable refresh succeeds. Retained revocation events may have sequence gaps, but duplicate or decreasing sequences are rejected. Offline login does not call Identify.

The baseline emergency suite passed 49 tests. The updated suite passed all 57 tests, including reset, legacy migration, retention, missing-ID rejection, concurrent refresh, and refresh failure across restart. An independent AI source review found a trust-refresh race during development; it was corrected and the final review reported no remaining blockers. This is source review and local test evidence, not human approval or production certification.

Commands used from the solution directory:

```powershell
dotnet test ./WebAppNetCore.Emergency.Tests/WebAppNetCore.Emergency.Tests.csproj --disable-build-servers /m:1 /p:UseSharedCompilation=false /p:UseRazorBuildServer=false
$publishDirectory = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'codex-oidc-emergency-setup\publish'
dotnet publish ./WebAppNetCore/WebAppNetCore.csproj -c Release --no-restore --disable-build-servers /m:1 /p:UseSharedCompilation=false /p:UseRazorBuildServer=false -o $publishDirectory
dotnet build-server shutdown
```

The Release publish succeeded. Existing compiler warnings remained visible. The deployed `WebAppNetCore.dll` was checked against the publish output and its SHA-256 hash matched.

## Configuration applied

1. Located the two IIS application pools by their deployment paths. The non-elevated session could not manage IIS, so the reviewed setup script ran through an Administrator PowerShell process.
2. Verified that the existing protected private key could be opened on this machine with the configured audience. The private key was not regenerated or printed.
3. Created a separate Identify configuration directory. Granted the resolved Runtime pool identity read access there and modify access to its `state` subdirectory. Identify was not granted access to the sample's private decryption key.
4. Backed up the original Runtime Web.config, sample appsettings, and sample DLL/PDB. The script also supports backing up existing issuer settings and signing trust before replacement.
5. Stopped both pools and waited for their old workers to exit. This avoided overlapping owners of the protected state files.
6. With the user's explicit approval, replaced the two invalid machine secrets with distinct cryptographically random values. Set the backend variable on both pools and the operator variable only on the sample pool. The variables have machine scope; the operator value was explicitly injected only into the sample pool. Secret values were not printed or committed.
7. Wrote Identify's issuer JSON using the supplied connection GUID, the deployed normal client ID, and the existing public JWK's `kid`, `n`, and `e`. Set `EmergencyIssuer.SettingsFile` in the deployed Runtime configuration.
8. Started Identify and downloaded its emergency public signing keys over certificate-validated HTTPS. Checked the response before saving it as the sample's signing trust. No certificate-validation bypass was used.
9. Copied the verified sample DLL/PDB into the stopped deployment. Merged only the complete `EmergencyCredential` section into deployed appsettings, preserving normal-login settings.
10. Wrote the supported `support-disabled` marker before starting the sample. This ensures that any prior acceptance state is reset. Started the sample and checked the operator page.

The script keeps rollback copies and restores changed configuration, binaries, trust, and environment values if applying the changes fails. If rollback itself fails, it leaves the affected pools stopped. Existing state files are never deleted as a configuration shortcut.

## Resulting files and secrets

| Purpose | Location or variable |
|---|---|
| Identify settings | `C:\ProgramData\Safewhere\EmergencyIssuer\dev520\issuer-settings.json` |
| Identify state | `C:\ProgramData\Safewhere\EmergencyIssuer\dev520\state` |
| Sample external settings source | `C:\ProgramData\SafewhereSamples\OidcEmergency\dev520\emergency-settings.json` |

Backups from this setup are under `C:\ProgramData\Safewhere\EmergencyIssuer\dev520\backups\20261020-161208` and `C:\ProgramData\SafewhereSamples\OidcEmergency\backups\20261020-161208`. They are deployment artifacts and must remain outside source control.

Local execution evidence and the reviewed setup script are under `%TEMP%\codex-oidc-emergency-setup`, including `setup-result.json`, test logs/TRX files, publish output, and `Complete-OidcEmergencySetup.ps1`. The script is specific to this local deployment; the README provides the reusable procedure. The successful result recorded both pool names, file locations, generated variable names, and HTTP 200 from the operator page. It contains no secret values.

## Observed outcome and next steps

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Identify emergency signing keys | HTTP 200 |
| Normal OIDC discovery | HTTP 200 |
| Sample home page | HTTP 200 |
| Sample emergency operator page | HTTP 200 |
| Sample emergency login page | HTTP 403, expected while acceptance is off |
| Published/deployed assembly comparison | Hashes matched |

Server setup is complete, and emergency acceptance is off. A full browser preparation and physical-authenticator login were not performed by the setup script.

The user must sign out and perform a fresh normal login, open `/emergency`, and complete registration, browser storage/read-back, and possession confirmation. Then sign in at `/emergency/operator` with the new operator key and activate acceptance deliberately. The README includes the local clipboard command for that key. Preserve the deployed emergency configuration during future publishes; the source template remains disabled by default.
## October 23, 2026: deployed PoC configuration correction

Verified the newly deployed dev520 Runtime and OIDC application support direct `ApiKey` configuration. Updated `C:\ProgramData\Safewhere\EmergencyIssuer\dev520\issuer-settings.json` to use the existing backend key values directly in each client entry and set record/enrollment/credential lifetimes to 24 hours / 1 hour / 30 days. No key rotation or state deletion was performed.

Updated `C:\ProgramData\SafewhereSamples\OidcEmergency\dev520\emergency-settings.json` and synchronized its `EmergencyCredential` section to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\kombitoidc\appsettings.json`, because the application does not automatically load the external JSON. Removed retired access-token, operator, and claim-filter options. Enabled the dedicated emergency Information-level logging category for Console and Debug providers. Existing identifiers, encryption/trust files, protection keys, and state paths were preserved.

Stopped and started only Identify dev520 and the OIDC pool. Both health endpoints returned HTTP 200; the OIDC response included its diagnostic reference header. Verified the configured OIDC API keys match. Configuration backups are at `C:\ProgramData\Safewhere\EmergencyIssuer\dev520\backups\poc-settings-20261023-160041` (settings-0.json=issuer, settings-1.json=external OIDC, settings-2.json=deployed appsettings).

Also corrected a stale deployed `wwwroot\js\emergency-credential.js` that still displayed the old local-block message and lacked browser cleanup/control switching. Copied the current source script, verified its hash, and refreshed the embedded browser without restarting the app. Its backup is `C:\ProgramData\SafewhereSamples\OidcEmergency\backups\browser-script-20261023-160415.js`.

Fresh normal login was observed in the embedded browser. The preparation page now shows only **Prepare this browser**, with no stored credential listed. New credential preparation and verification of its 30-day lifetime and complete ID-token claim snapshot are the next test steps.

### PoC authenticator-policy alignment

The first live preparation after the settings update reached Identify successfully (enrollment and completion both returned 201) but failed local validation with `invalid_request`, reference `69f827542bbb47218d9b29e9924d1e01`. The deployed issuer matched the current build and issued `hardware_policy=poc-up`; the clients still accepted only `poc-uv-nonbackup`.

The user explicitly approved aligning both clients to `poc-up`: require user presence, prefer user verification, and allow valid backup-eligible/backed-up passkeys. Both client sources, UI text, fixtures, and guides were updated. Invalid BS-without-BE combinations remain rejected, along with invalid signature/origin/RP/ownership/challenge/counter proofs. Verification passed 69 OIDC tests and 105 SAML tests; focused review found no actionable issues.

The updated OIDC DLL/PDB and static JS/CSS were deployed and hash-checked. Backup: `C:\Users\caotr\AppData\Local\Temp\oidc-poc-up-deploy\backup-20261023-161420`. OIDC health returned 200. SAML source is updated, but its policy-alignment deployment is still pending. A fresh OIDC login completed through SSO and a new preparation was started for the user's key/passkey prompts. The earlier issued-but-unaccepted binding may still count toward the issuer's key limit; avoid repeated new enrollments if this next attempt fails.

The first retry was rejected by the authenticator because the failed earlier registration was still in Identify's exclusion list. The issuer audit identified the orphaned binding ending `Et02M8`. With explicit user approval, that specific binding was revoked through the authenticated issuer API (HTTP 204). A fresh normal login then completed through SSO and preparation was retried. No other binding was revoked by this cleanup.

### Successful end-to-end OIDC verification

The clean retry completed registration, credential storage, and possession verification. The new credential became Active and expires on November 22, 2026, confirming the 30-day issuer lifetime. Emergency login with that credential then succeeded. The emergency home page displays the original ID-token snapshot, including sub, sid, jti, repeated aud values, nonce, at_hash, azp, iat, nbf, exp, and iss, alongside locally generated emergency-session controls. No raw token or claim value is recorded here. The active session's own eight-hour limit remains independent of the credential lifetime and original ID-token expiry.
